# facial-morse
A computer vision project to translate Morse code, generated by opening/closing of the eyes and mouth, into plain English.

## Facial morse system
- Left eye blink = dot
- Right eye blink = dash
- Both blink = end of word
- Open mouth = begin/end translation

## How to run locally from CLI
1) Ensure python3, pip, OpenCV4 (and its dependencies) are installed on your system
2) Clone the repo onto your system
3) Create a virtual environment:
```commandline
# for example, using python venv:
cd /path/to/repo
python -m venv venv_name
```
4) Activate virtual environment and install the project dependencies
```commandline
# for example, using python venv:
source /venv_name/bin/activate
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5) Run the program:
```commandline
python3 main.py --shape-predictor shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
```


NOTE: This project uses the "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks" for facial landmark detection. 
It should be included when you clone the repo. If not, just google it and download the .dat 
file into the root of the project.
